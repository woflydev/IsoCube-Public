Are you a sad person suffering from a slow brain? 

Are you sad?

And are you a person?

If you answered 'yes' to any of the questions above, we have properly determined you are in need of thorough therapeutic care, as your brain indeed functions way too slow to be considered 'alive'. 

IsoCube can help you improve your anger management by providing a happy and rage-suppressing environment to perfect your skills!

This game will definitely not -
1) Trash talk you.

3) Make you take toilet breaks.
4) Put you in a rehabilitation center.

Warning: this game may make you blow up your computer. Oh it's fine, just play it and have fun while you're at it!
